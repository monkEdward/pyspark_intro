Input: a textual csv file containing the daily value of PM10 for a set of sensors
    ▪Each line of the files has the following format: sensorId,date,PM10 value (μg/m3 )\n

Output: the sensors with at least 2 readings with a PM10 value greater than the critical threshold 50
    ▪Store in an HDFS file the sensorIds of the selected sensors and also the number of times each of those sensors is
     associated with a PM10 value greater than 50


i.e
s1,2016-01-02,60.2
s2,2016-01-02,20.4
s1,2016-01-03,55.5

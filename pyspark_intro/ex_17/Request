Input:
    A CSV file containing a list of user profiles
        ▪Header
        ▪name,age,gender
        ▪Each line of the file contains the information about one user
Output:
    Select male users (gender=“male”), increase by one their age, and store in 
     the output folder name and age of these users sorted by decreasing age and 
     ascending name (if the age value is the same)
    The output does not contain the header line

i.e.
input data:
name,age,gender
Paul,40,male
John,40,male
David,15,male
Susan,40,female
Karen,34,female

---
output:
John,41
Paul,41
David,16

Implement two different solutions for this exercise
    A solution based only on DataFrames
    A solution based on SQL like queries executed on a temporary table associated with the input data

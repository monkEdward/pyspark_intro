Input:
    A CSV file containing a list of user profiles
        ▪Header: name,surname,age
        ▪Each line of the file contains one profile
        ▪name,surname,age
Output:
    A csv file containing one line for each profile. The original age attribute is substituted with 
     a new attributed called rangeage of type String
        ▪rangeage = "[" + (age/10)*10 + "-" + (age/10)*10 +9"]"

i.e.
input data:
name,age,gender
Paolo,Garza,42
Luca,Boccia,41
Maura,Bianchi,16

---
output:
Paolo,Garza,[40-49]
Luca,Boccia,[40-49]
Maura,Bianchi,[10-19]

Implement two different solutions for this exercise
    A solution based only on DataFrames
    A solution based on SQL like queries executed on a temporary table associated with the input data

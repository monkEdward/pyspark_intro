Input:

        ▪Header
            ▪name,age,gender
        ▪Each line of the file contains the information about one user
Output:
    Select the names occurring at least two times and store in the output 
     folder name and average(age) of the selected names

Paul,38,male
David,15,male
Susan,40,female
Susan,34,female

---
output:

Implement two different solutions for this exercise
    A solution based only on DataFrames
    A solution based on SQL like queries executed on a temporary table associated with the input data
